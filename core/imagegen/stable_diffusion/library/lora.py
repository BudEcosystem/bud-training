    # 1) - the "hidden_size", which is increased according to `unet.config.block_out_channels`.
    # 2) - the "cross attention size", which is set to `unet.config.cross_attention_dim`.

    # Let's first see how many attention processors we will have to set.
    # For Stable Diffusion, it should be equal to:
    # - down blocks (2x attention layers) * (2x transformer layers) * (3x down blocks) = 12
    # - mid blocks (2x attention layers) * (1x transformer layers) * (1x mid blocks) = 2
    # - up blocks (2x attention layers) * (3x transformer layers) * (3x down blocks) = 18
    # => 32 layers
